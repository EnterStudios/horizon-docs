# RethinkDB Horizon Docs

This is the repository for the Horizon documentation. These are maintained in [GitHub-Flavored Markdown][GFM], using [Kramdown][].

[GFM]:      https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/
[Kramdown]: http://kramdown.gettalong.org

Run `./build.rb target_dir` to generate a static website from the documentation.

At some point in the past (or in a different branch) this used Jekyll.
